    Bloom is a concept company/mobile application that I created as a personal project. Bloom is a delivery app for flowers and floral arrangements. The core feature of the app is linking the user with local floral shops and using a decentralized delivery service for optimal
    efficiency and speed. Due to such a broad user base, the brand identity for Bloom needed to be fun and inviting but still retain a professional aesthetic. After extensive competitor and market research I developed brand
    standards that would not ensure the brandmark stood out amongst its competitors. I used soft floral colors for the logo and included them in the wordmark as well to provide unity. I chose a rounded typeface for the wordmark so that it would compliment the style and
    aesthetic of the logo. I created this project using Illustrator.

    Bloom is a concept company/mobile application that I created as a personal project. Bloom is a delivery app for flowers and floral arrangements. When designing the Welcome screen, I wanted to make it inviting to the user by including complimentary colors and subtle backgrounds.
    By using a darker overlay on the background, the logo and call to action buttons are able to stand out. In a final product, the background would most likely be a video that would be more engaging with the user. With the Home screen, I created the layout to make the flowers stand out and
    really sell themselves. I chose specific sections of the app that the user would most likely want to reach the fastest. I also made the search bar a key feature for the user that needs to find flowers fast! I created this project using Photoshop, Illustrator, and InVision Studio.

    Bloom is a concept company/mobile application that I created as a personal project. Bloom is a delivery app for flowers and floral arrangements. The Collections screen serves as the main hub to access specific items or curated collection. As seen in the interactive prototype, the different
    items are all swipeable with a simple gesture which keeps the interface clean for usability. As with most of the app design, I wanted to let the flowers really stand out since they are the sole reason that anyone would be using the app. I used rounded rectangles throughout the app design to provide
    an easy to follow design system and style guide for each layout. I incorporated bright and festive colors in the Collections page design so that the user would stay interested while scrolling through. On each Item page, there is the option to add the item to your cart as a gift. Since most flowers are
    sent as gifts, it is essential that this feature stands out and is easy to locate for the user. I used varying colors for each important element to allow the user to be drawn to different aspects of the page. For example, the review/rating star or the contrasting gift and Add To Cart buttons. A short description
    for each item provides a final selling point for the provider. I created this project using Photoshop, Illustrator, and InVision Studio.

    Bloom is a concept company/mobile application that I created as a personal project. Bloom is a delivery app for flowers and floral arrangements. For the Shopping Cart screen, I made it easily maneuverable with all of the buttons having clear contrasting colors for fast usability. Since many orders would be in bulk, especially
    for weddings, I created a system to quickly add and subtract items from the cart. This is represented in the Interactive Prototype. The Shopping Cart screen is accessible on every page of the app so that a user can finalize their purchase at any point. The Shopping Cart icon turns into the green color when the user is on that
    specific page so that they know which screen they are on. The Menu screen is also accessible from any part of the app and has several useful links for the user. The user can simply click on the grayed out part of the Menu screen to return to the page that they were viewing. This allows for the user to navigate around the app with ease
    and find any specific item. I created this project using Photoshop, Illustrator, and InVision Studio.

<p> En Garde is a concept company/mobile application that I created as a personal project. The brand identity behind the app was extremely important in driving the design direction of the project. I wanted to create an identity that was modern, simplistic, and memorable. To achieve this, I went through a lengthy concepting process that included researching other popular fencing brands, sketching different logos, and working with font pairings. Since the main feature of this project was the mobile application, I needed to create a brand that would easily transition into a mobile setting. A core feature of the app is the ability to challenge anyone else who has the app to a fencing duel. For that reason, I included the clashing swords as the main feature of the logo. I created this brandmark in Illustrator.

  This sticker series was developed as a free gift that is placed in every online order package before it is shipped out. The goal was to create something memorable and engaging that still fit brand guidelines. I chose to work with the piranha logo directly since it would emphasizes
  brand recognition and I felt it would be something that the customer would actually want to show off. I included the palm tree leaf pattern on the sticker to retain the summer/beach theme of the brand. With so many different color combinations, it implores the customer to purchase
  more sunglasses so they can collect all of the different types of stickers. I created these stickers completely in Illustrator.

  I created these three videos as quick advertisements for social media. These were meant to be short but concise while still enticing and informing the customer of new or product lines. Since there are so many different categories of sunglasses under the Piranha brand, I had to
  create a different video for each brand while still retaining a semblance of continuity between them. For each video, I storyboarded the general flow of the video before going into production. This allowed me to experiment more with each video and helped me make them unique but somewhat similar.
  I created assets for the videos in Photoshop and Illustrator before I animated everything in After Effects.

Each style is on the same sunglasses display so every style needed its own section divider.
  I worked with the Creative Director to establish different brand aesthetics and guidelines. I analyzed each pair of sunglasses so that each divider would accurately represent its corresponding style. I used Photoshop and Illustrator to create the display dividers.

<p> I designed this website under a freelance contract. This project was a redesign of an existing website. I coded some of the front end development for this website in HTML, SCSS, and JS but it is unpublished and currently still in production. Mondial Technology Group resells and recycles telecommunications equipment around the world. Their target audience is large telecommunications companies so this website had to be professional yet engaging. I designed the website to have clear call to actions for requesting a quote for projects and an integrated help desk. There was an emphasis on this website being lightweight yet fast and being able to work on any platform.

<p>I designed these promotions under a freelance contract. I created several marketing promotions for City Bark, a dog daycare and boarding facility chain in Colorado. I used stock photography and I personally created any external graphics needed for each promotion. I worked directly with the marketing manager to create the copy for each campaign. I also managed the file production and color management for different deliverables; print, web, and email. With each promotion there was an emphasis on a fun and exciting environment at each City Bark location.

We met with the marketing director and principal of Flagstaff Academy, a STEM school located in Colorado, to rebrand their school and provide some mockup collateral. I lead the design process for my team’s brandmark and I included a microchip shape to form the wings of the dragon to reference the school’s focus on technology. I wanted the shape of the dragon to fit directly inside a circle and could be used as such in certain circumstances.

<p>This project was created during my time at Studio M, a service learning internship through Metropolitan State University Of Denver. Cheltenham Elementary School (CES) is located in the Denver Public School (DPS) system and serves an extremely diverse student body. CES reached out to Studio M for a complete rebranding and beautification of the school. After meeting with the client multiple times, we decided on pursuing a superhero and comic book aesthetic for the school to create an engaging and fun environment for the students. I was tasked with creating multiple banners that would be hung around the fence line of the school to draw in new families. I also developed an environmental system that emphasizes the importance of school through ten different creative comic style bubbles. The message behind these designs is to empower the students at the school and drive their desire to learn.
